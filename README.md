# servlet-notebook-Java

Servlet for working with a notebook. Each person's name and a list of phone numbers (there may be several of them) are stored in the notebook. At startup, the servlet loads a notebook from a text file. The servlet must allow:
1. View the list of entries
2. Add a new user
3. Add a new phone

There is a list of entries on the main page of the servlet. At the top of the page links --- add. Each of the links leads to a separate page, where the necessary data is entered in the form using the <input type="text" name="username" /> elements. There is a submit button to send data to the servlet.
